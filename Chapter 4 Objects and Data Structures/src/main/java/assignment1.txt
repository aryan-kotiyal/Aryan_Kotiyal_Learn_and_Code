class Employee {
  string name;
  int age;
  float salary;

public:
  string getName();
  void setName(string name);

Employee employee;

Is 'employee' an object or a data structure? Why?

Here in this code sample 'employee' is a object as the Employee class has private fields
and the only way to access those fields is the getters and setters that the class has
provided.
