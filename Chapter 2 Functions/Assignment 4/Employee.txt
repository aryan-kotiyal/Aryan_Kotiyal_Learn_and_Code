This class is violating the SRP principle as it is doing multiple things.
This class has multiple reasons to change.
To make this class follow SOLID Principles, class should be broken into smaller classes.
saveEmployeeTODatabase() method should be used in a separate class that handles the database operations
printEmployeeDetailReportXML() & printEmployeeDetailReportCSV() methods should be used in a separate class that handle the report printing.
terminateEmployee() & isWorking() method should be used in a separate class which handles the business logic.
